# TSB
## TypeScript Backend Boilerplate
### A shortcut around getting a new Typescript project initialized with Mocha and NYC configured

### To run for sample input
redirect a file in such as the following:
```
./node_modules/ts-node/dist/bin.js src/index.ts < samples/a.txt
```

### Install and run tests
```
npm install --dev
npm build
npm run test
```
